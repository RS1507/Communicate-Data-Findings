# Communicate-Data-Findings
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree: Communicate Data Findings Project

In this project, I investigated trip data of users in San Francisco Bay Area. The main focus was to wrangle and explore a `201902-fordgobike-tripdata` datafile by using Python visualization libraries, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
